Goal: Write 20 Ideas.


Words: 
Block, validator, nomination, identiefs, age nodes, active, join, people, big big, chosen, connection, state, exists
Cube, Sphere, Pyramid 

Create a Persona:
A International travel travels the world. 
He meets many people. He wants to schow cool stuff. 
He speaks about valdiator and nominator 
He speaks about the pink logo. 
He speaks about how money is floating. 
He speaks about transaction. 
He speaks about dot. 
He speaks about parachains. 
He speaks about the weirdness.
He speaks about how ti will revoluite the world. 
He speaks about Smart Contracts. 
He speaks about Blocks. 
Big fucking Blocks. 
He seaks about banks. 
He speaks about governance. 
He speaks about votes.
He speaks about proposal.
He speaks about traffice.
He really doesn like trafic.
He speaks about drawing.
He speaks about shapes.
He speaks about how abstract things are. 
Its all data. 


Come up with 1 Idea:
Lets combine all staked in a Sphere. 
The sphere has a beaitufi dynamic shader. 
The shader moves lines around the sphere. 
The shader is written in glsl.
The speed of how the lines are moving is defined by the staked. 


Data: 
We know how much stake a validator has
We can in real time receive the blocks, and know which validator signed it
We also know how many nominators a validator has
We can also explode the blocks into events in the block
Events have different types, most common is para inclusion from another chain
Array Addresses Number
Nominators

# Ideation

It follows the following structure: 

- Put all lego stones on the table.  
- Put all lego moves on the table
- Come up with bullshit
- Get it of shit
- Come up bulls
- Descripte bulls
- Prompt the bulls

## Lego Stones & Lego Moves

irregular, smooth, jagged, sleek, factured,
elongated, twisted, bulky, chunky, benty, swirly, 
rippled, spiraly, hilly, wavy

Nouns:  
Box, Sphere, Cylinder, ConeGeometry

Combined:
Chunky Box, Bubbly Sphere, Pointy Cylinder, 
Curved ConeGeometry, Wobbly Torus, Flashy Plane, 
Jagged Octahedron, Swirly Tetrahedron, 
Bent Dodecahedron, Wavy Icosahedron, Smooth Box, 
Irregular Sphere, Sleek Cylinder, 
Twisted ConeGeometry, Rippled Torus, 
Factured Plane, Spiraly Octahedron, 
Hilly Tetrahedron, Flashy Dodecahedron, 
Elongated Icosahedron, 

### Make stupid sentence:

- Chunky Box

Take the first validator address, make a number out of it.
Create a function which takes a number as input and spit out a number between 1 and 10. We call this number chunkiness.
Create a three JS Scene. The ThreeJS Scene shows a chunky cube. The chunkiness is defines chunkyiness of the the cube.
0 is normal cube, 10 is fully chunky. 

- Wobbly Torus

Take the stake fo the first validator and create a variable. 
We call this variable firstValidatorStake.
Create a Three JS Scene. The ThreeJs Scene show a woobly Torus. 
Create a shader material for the torus. 
The vertex shader of the cube lets a sinus curve rise thruh the Torus.
The speed of the the sinus curve is defined by the firstValidatorStake.
If the stake is high it wobbles really fast.
If the stake is low it wobbles slow.
If the stake is 0 it barely wobbles.
The fragment shader of the Torus is a fixed color.
It changes color between red and blue. 
If the stake is high its full red.
If the stake is 0 its full blue.
Also include emission. Is the firstValidatorStake high it has high emission. 
If its low, it has low emission.

- Flashy Dodecahedron

Take the blocknumber and create a variable.
We call this variable blocknumber.
Create a ThreeJS Scene. 
The ThreeJS Scene shows a Flashy Dodecahedron. 
If the blocknumber is even then the Dodecahedron just flashing irregular. 
The code uses emission variable and increases emission and decresses mission every frame. 
If the blocknumber is odd, it doesn't flash.

- Sunny Sphere. 

Take the blocktimestamp and make a variable. 
We call this variable blocktimestamp. 
Calculate based on the blocktimestamp if its early morning, morning, early evening, evening. 
Create a ThreeJS Scene.
The ThreeJS Scene shows a sunny sphere.
The sphere switches between 
lightblack, morningred, morning yellow, bright yellow, evening red and lightblack.
If its early morning use morningred for the material. 
If its morning use morning yellow for the material .
If its early evening use eveningred for the material.
If its evening use lightblack for the material.
Between the sates use a gradient betweent the attached colors. 

- Puffy Icosahedron

Take the status of the current block. 
We call this variable current_status.
It has 3 states. 
Create a ThreeJS Scene. 
The ThreeJS Scene shows a puffy icosahedron.
State 1 lets icosahedron appear. It scales from scale 0 to scale 1. 
State 2 lets icosahedron scale furth. It scales from scale 1 to scale 5.
State 3 lets the icosahedron explode. Its increases emission really fast 300ms to fully bright and then its hides the icosahedron.
Attach a colorful material to icosahedron. It should look nice. Use pastel colors in redish yellowish colors.

- popping validators.

Take all the validtors make an array out of it. 
We call this array allValidaotrs.
Take the latest validtor, create a variable out of it. 
We call this variable currentValidator.
For each valdiator create a dull red cube.
Check every frame which currentValidator is selected.
The selected currentValidator gets super shiny green.
Create a Shadermaterial for him and make him spiky with a vertexshader ander a fragmentshader.
